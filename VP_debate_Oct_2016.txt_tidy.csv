"3","QUIJANO","the campaigns have agreed to the rules of this minute debate there will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer then ill ask followup questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates by coin toss its been determined that senator kaine will be first to answer the opening question"
"4","QUIJANO","we have an enthusiastic audience tonight theyve agreed to only express that enthusiasm once at the end of the debate and right now as we welcome governor mike pence and senator tim kaine "
"5","QUIJANO","gentlemen welcome it truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight"
"6","QUIJANO","id like to start with the topic of presidential leadership twentyeight years ago tomorrow night lloyd bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency but about how if tragedy should occur the vice president has to step in without any margin for error without time for preparation to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world"
"7","QUIJANO","what about your qualities your skills and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moments notice senator kaine"
"8","KAINE","elaine thank you for being here tonight and governor pence welcome it is so great to be back at longwood university in farmville virginia"
"9","KAINE","this is a very special place sixtyfive years ago a young courageous woman barbara johns led a walkout of her high school moton high school she made history by protesting school segregation she believed our nation was stronger together and that walkout led to the brown v board of education decision that moved us down the path toward equality"
"10","KAINE","i am so proud to be running with another strong historymaking woman hillary clinton to be president of the united states im proud because her vision of stronger together building an economy that works for all not just those at the top being safe in the world not only with a strong military but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change and also to build a community of respect just like barbara johns tried to do years ago thats why im so proud to be her running mate"
"11","KAINE","hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate she said the test of a clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill itll be whether we can make somebodys life better whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers whether we can make a safer its going to be about results"
"12","KAINE","and she said to me youve been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer youve been a city councilman and mayor youve been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a senator i think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in peoples lives"
"13","KAINE","and thats what i bring to the ticket that experience having served at all levels of government but my primary role is to be hillary clintons righthand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible and i relish that role im so proud of her"
"14","KAINE","ill just say this we trust hillary clinton my wife and i and we trust her with the most important thing in our life we have a son deployed overseas in the marine corps right now we trust hillary clinton as president and commanderinchief but the thought of donald trump as commanderinchief scares us to death"
"15","QUIJANO","governor pence"
"16","PENCE","well first off thank you elaine and thank you to thank you to norwood university for their wonderful hospitality and the commission on presidential debates its deeply humbling for me to be here to be surrounded by my my wonderful family"
"17","PENCE","and senator kaine its an honor to be here with you as well and i just i also want to say i want to say thanks to everyone thats looking in tonight who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation"
"18","PENCE","for the last sevenandahalf years weve seen americas place in the world weakened weve seen an economy stifled by more taxes more regulation a war on coal and a failing health care reform come to be known as obamacare and the american people know that we need to make a change and so i want to thank all of you for being being with us tonight"
"19","PENCE","i also want to thank donald trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket i have to tell you im a im a smalltown boy from a place not too different from farmville i grew up with a cornfield in my backyard my grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my sons age my mom and dad built a everything that matters in a small town in southern indiana they built a family and and a good name and a business and they raised a family and i dreamed some day of representing my home town in washington but i honestly elaine i never imagined never imagined id have the opportunity to be governor of the state that i love let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position"
"20","PENCE","so to answer your question i would say i i would hope that if if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role that i would meet it with the way that im going to meet the responsibility should i be elected vice president of the united states and thats to bring a lifetime of experience a lifetime growing up in a small town a lifetime where ive served in the congress of the united states where where ive led a state that works in the great state of indiana and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this i i would hope and frankly i would pray to be able to meet that moment with that that lifetime of experience"
"21","QUIJANO","senator kaine on the campaign trail you praised secretary clintons character including her commitment to public service yet percent of voters dont think shes trustworthy why do so many people distrust her is it because they have questions about her emails and the clinton foundation"
"22","KAINE","elaine let me tell you why i trust hillary clinton heres what people should look at as they look at a public servant do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life and have they held onto that passion throughout their life regardless of whether they were in office or not succeeding or failing"
"23","KAINE","hillary clinton has that passion from a time as a kid in a methodist youth group in the suburbs of chicago she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids as a civil rights lawyer in the south with the childrens defense fund first lady of arkansas and this country senator secretary of state its always been about putting others first and thats a sharp contrast with donald trump"
"24","KAINE","donald trump always puts himself first he built a business career in the words of one of his own campaign staffers off the backs of the little guy and as a candidate he started his campaign with a speech where he called mexicans rapists and criminals and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that president obama wasnt born in the united states"
"25","KAINE","it is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an africanamerican could not be a citizen of the united states and i cant imagine how governor pence can defend the insult driven selfish me first style of donald trump"
"26","QUIJANO","governor pence let me ask you you have said donald trump is quote thoughtful compassionate and steady yet percent of voters feel he is a risky choice and percent feel he does not have the right kind of temperament to be president why do so many americans think mr trump is simply too erratic"
"27","PENCE","well let me let me say first and foremost that senator you and hillary clinton would know a lot about an insult driven campaign it really is remarkable at a time when literally in the wake of hillary clintons tenure as secretary of state where she was the architect of the obama administrations foreign policy we see entire portions of the world particularly the wider middle east literally spinning out of control i mean the situation were watching hour by hour in syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that hillary clinton helped lead in this administration and create the newly emboldened the aggression of russia whether it was in ukraine or now theyre heavyhanded approach"
"28","KAINE","you guys love russia you both have said"
"29","PENCE","their heavyhanded approach"
"30","KAINE","you both have said you both have said vladimir putin is a better leader than the president"
"31","PENCE","well"
"32","QUIJANO","well were going to get to russia in just a moment but i do want to get back to the question at"
"33","PENCE","but in the midst elaine thank you thank you thank you senator ill"
"34","KAINE","these guys have praised vladimir putin as a great leader how can that"
"35","QUIJANO","yes and we will get to that senator we do have that coming up here but in the meantime the questions"
"36","PENCE","well senator i must have hit ai must have hit a nerve here"
"37","QUIJANO","why the disconnect"
"38","PENCE","because at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation where weve weakened americas place in the world stifled americas economy the campaign of hillary clinton and tim kaine has been an avalanche of insults"
"39","PENCE","look to get to your question about trustworthiness donald trump has built a business through hard times and through good times hes brought an extraordinary business acumen hes employed tens of thousands of people in this country"
"40","KAINE","and paid few taxes and lost a billion a year"
"41","QUIJANO","and why the disconnect with your running mate"
"42","PENCE","but theres a theres a reason why people question the trustworthiness of hillary clinton and thats because theyre paying attention i mean the reality is when she was secretary of state senator come on she had a clinton foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments"
"43","KAINE","you are donald trumps apprentice let me talk about this"
"44","PENCE","senator i think im still on my time"
"45","KAINE","well i think isnt this a discussion"
"46","QUIJANO","this is our open discussion"
"47","KAINE","yeah lets talk about the state of"
"48","PENCE","well let me let me you and finish my sentence if i can"
"49","KAINE","finish your sentence"
"50","PENCE","the clinton foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was secretary of state"
"51","KAINE","now i can weigh in now"
"52","PENCE","she had a private server"
"53","KAINE","now i get to weigh in now let me just say this"
"54","PENCE","that was discovered"
"55","QUIJANO","senator you have an opportunity to respond"
"56","PENCE","keep that pay to play process out of the reach of the public"
"57","KAINE","governor pence governor pence doesnt think the worlds going so well and he you know is going to say its everybodys fault"
"58","PENCE","do you"
"59","KAINE","let me tell you this when hillary clinton became secretary of state governor pence did you know that osama bin laden was alive"
"60","PENCE","yes"
"61","KAINE","do you know that we had troops deployed in the battlefield in iraq and afghanistan do you know that iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and russia was expanding its stockpile"
"62","KAINE","under secretary clintons leadership she was part of the national team public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin laden and wiped him off the face of the earth she worked to deal with the russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile she worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot"
"63","PENCE","eliminate the iranian nuclear weapons program"
"64","KAINE","absolutely without firing a shot and instead of american troops deployed overseas we now have "
"65","PENCE","right and"
"66","KAINE","these are very very good things"
"67","PENCE","and iraq has been overrun by isis because hillary clinton failed to renegotiate"
"68","KAINE","well if you want to put more american troops in iraq you can propose that"
"69","PENCE","hillary clinton hillary clinton hillary clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement"
"70","KAINE","no that is incorrect thats incorrect"
"71","PENCE","and so we removed we removed all of our"
"72","QUIJANO","gentlemen well get to"
"73","PENCE","troops from iraq and isis was able to be conjured up in that vacuum"
"74","KAINE","but id like to correct"
"75","PENCE","and overrun vast areas of iraq"
"76","KAINE","governor president bush said we would leave iraq at the end of and elaine iraq didnt want our troops to stay and they wouldnt give us the protection for our troops and guess what if a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay were not going to stay without their protection"
"77","PENCE","it was a failure of the secretary of state"
"78","QUIJANO","we need to move on to the next topic gentlemen"
"79","KAINE","if governor pence wants to put more troops back in iraq thats"
"80","QUIJANO","there are a lot of people wondering in this country about the economy lets turn to the issue of the economy"
"81","KAINE","ok"
"82","QUIJANO","according to the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing trillion gross national debt in fact your plans would add even more to it"
"83","QUIJANO","both of you were governors who balanced state budgets are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country governor pence"
"84","PENCE","i think the fact that that under this past administration was of which hillary clinton was a part weve almost doubled the national debt is atrocious i mean im very proud of the fact that i come from a state that works the state of indiana has balanced budgets we cut taxes weve made record investments in education and in infrastructure and i still finish my term with billion in the bank"
"85","PENCE","thats a little bit different than when senator kaine was governor here in virginia he actually he actually tried to raise taxes by about billion he left his state about billion in the hole in the state of indiana weve cut unemployment in half unemployment doubled when he was governor"
"86","PENCE","but i think hes a very fitting running mate for hillary clinton because in the wake of a season where american families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration hillary clinton and tim kaine want more of the same it really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases which i get that you tried to raise taxes here in virginia and were unsuccessful"
"87","PENCE","but a trillion dollars in tax increases more regulation more of the same war on coal and more of obamacare that now even former president bill clinton calls obamacare a crazy plan but hillary clinton and tim kaine want to build on obamacare they want to expand it into a singlepayer program and for all the world hillary clinton just thinks obamacare is a good start"
"88","PENCE","look donald trump and i have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the s just the way it worked in the s and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families small businesses and family farms ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in virginia repealing obamacare lock stock and barrel and repealing all of the executive orders that barack obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy"
"89","PENCE","we can get america moving again put on top of that the kind of trade deals thatll put the american worker first and youve got a prescription for real growth and when you get the economy growing elaine thats when you can deal with the national debt when we get back to percent to percent growth with donald trumps plan will do then were going to have the resources to meet our nations needs at home and abroad and were going to have the ability to bring down the national debt"
"90","QUIJANO","senator kaine"
"91","KAINE","elaine on the economy theres a fundamental choice for the american electorate do you want a youre hired president in hillary clinton or do you want a youre fired president in donald trump i think thats not such a hard choice"
"92","KAINE","hillary and i have a plan thats on the table thats a youre hired plan five components first thing we do is we invest in manufacturing infrastructure and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow second thing is we invest in our workforce from prek education to great teachers to debtfree college and tuitionfree college for families that make less than a year"
"93","KAINE","third we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage so you cant work fulltime and be under the poverty level and by paying women equal pay for equal work"
"94","KAINE","fourth we promote small business growth just as weve done in virginia to make it easier to start and grow small businesses hillary and i each grew up in smallbusiness families my dad who ran an iron working and welding shop is here tonight"
"95","KAINE","and fifth we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top whove benefited as weve come out of recession to pay more"
"96","KAINE","the trump plan is a different plan its a youre fired plan and theres two key elements to it first donald trump said wages are too high and both donald trump and mike pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage"
"97","KAINE","mike pence when he was in congress voted against raising the minimum wage above and he has been a oneman bulwark against minimum wage increases in indiana"
"98","KAINE","the second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like donald trump the problem with this elaine is thats exactly what we did years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession the deepest recession since the s"
"99","KAINE","independent analysts say the clinton plan would grow the economy by million jobs the trump plan would cost million jobs and donald trump why would he do this because his tax plan basically helps him and if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the american public like he said he would we would see just how much his economic plan is really a trumpfirst plan"
"100","QUIJANO","on that point governor pence recently the new york times released part of mr trumps tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years yesterday mr trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible does that seem fair to you"
"101","PENCE","well first let me say i appreciated the youre hired youre fired thing senator you use that a whole lot and i think your running mate used a lot of predone lines"
"102","PENCE","look what what you all just heard out there is more taxes trillion in more spending more deficits more debt more government and if you think thats all working then you look at the other side of the table i mean the truth of the matter is the policies of this administration which hillary clinton and senator kaine want to continue have run this economy into a ditch were in the"
"103","KAINE","fifteen million new jobs"
"104","PENCE","slowest economic recovery since the great depression"
"105","KAINE","fifteen million new jobs"
"106","QUIJANO","governor"
"107","PENCE","there are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that barack obama with hillary clinton at his side"
"108","KAINE","and the poverty level and the median income"
"109","PENCE","stepped into the oval office"
"110","KAINE","improved dramatically between and "
"111","PENCE","you honestly senator you can roll out the numbers and the sunny side but i got to tell you people in scranton know different people in fort wayne indiana know different i mean this economy is struggling the answer to this economy is not more taxes"
"112","KAINE","but its not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top"
"113","PENCE","its not more spending"
"114","KAINE","i am interested to hear whether hell defend his running mates not releasing taxes and not paying taxes"
"115","PENCE","absolutely i will"
"116","QUIJANO","governor with all due respect the question was about whether it seems fair to you that mr trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible"
"117","PENCE","well this is probably the difference between donald trump and hillary clinton and senator kaine and i mean hillary clinton and senator kaine god bless you for it career public servants thats great donald trump is a businessman not a career politician he actually built a business"
"118","PENCE","those tax returns that were that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times years ago but like virtually every other business including the new york times not too long ago he used whats called net operating loss we have a tax code senator that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country"
"119","KAINE","but why wont he release his tax returns"
"120","PENCE","well were answering the question about about a business thing is he"
"121","KAINE","i do want to come back to that but"
"122","PENCE","his tax returns his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time but he used the tax code just the way its supposed to be used and he did it brilliantly"
"123","KAINE","how do you know that you havent seen his tax returns"
"124","PENCE","he created a runway because hes created a business thats worth billions of dollars today"
"125","KAINE","how do you know that"
"126","PENCE","and with regard to paying taxes this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didnt pay taxes for years donald trump has created tens of thousands of jobs and hes paid payroll taxes sales taxes property taxes"
"127","KAINE","elaine let me talk about something"
"128","QUIJANO","senator im going to give you about seconds to respond and i have question on social security for you"
"129","KAINE","ok"
"130","PENCE","the only issue on taxes hillary clinton is going to raise taxes and donald trump and i are going to cut them"
"131","KAINE","donald trump started this campaign in and he said if i run for president i will absolutely release my taxes hes broken his first"
"132","PENCE","and he will"
"133","KAINE","hes broken his first promise second he stood on the stage"
"134","PENCE","he hasnt broken his promise he said hes"
"135","KAINE","he stood on the stage last week and when hillary said you havent been paying taxes he said that makes me smart so its smart not to pay for our military its smart not to pay for veterans its smart not to pay for teachers and i guess all of us who do pay for those things i guess were stupid and the last thing ill say is this"
"136","PENCE","senator do you take all the deductions that youre entitled to"
"137","KAINE","the last thing the last thing i want to ask governor pence is"
"138","PENCE","i do"
"139","KAINE","governor pence had to give donald trump his tax returns to show he was qualified to be vice president donald trump must give the american public his tax returns to show that hes qualified to be president and hes breaking his promise"
"140","PENCE","elaine i have to respond to this"
"141","QUIJANO","you get very little time seconds"
"142","PENCE","ill be ill be very respectful"
"143","QUIJANO","governor"
"144","PENCE","look donald trump has filed over pages of financial disclosure which is what the law requires"
"145","KAINE","but he said he would release his tax returns"
"146","QUIJANO","all right gentlemen"
"147","PENCE","the american people can review that and hes going senator hes going to release his tax returns when the audit is over"
"148","QUIJANO","i need to ask you about social security"
"149","KAINE","richard nixon released tax returns when he was under audit"
"150","PENCE","theyre going to raise your taxes were going to cut your taxes"
"151","QUIJANO","gentlemen"
"152","KAINE","if you cant meet nixons standard"
"153","QUIJANO","the people at home cannot understand either one of you when you speak over each other i would please ask you to wait until it is that the other is finished"
"154","KAINE","all right were having fun up here"
"155","QUIJANO","senator kaine on the issue of social security in years when the social security trust funds run out of money youll be the committee for a responsible federal budget estimates your benefits could be cut by as much as per year what would your administration do to prevent this cut"
"156","KAINE","first were going to protect social security which is one of the greatest programs that the american government has ever done it happened at a time when you would work your whole life your whole life raising your kids working being a little league coach or a sunday school teacher and then you would retire into poverty and social security has enabled people to retire with dignity and overwhelmingly not be in poverty"
"157","KAINE","we have to keep it solvent and we will keep it solvent and well look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that"
"158","KAINE","heres what hillary and i will not do and i want to make this very plain we will never ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize social security donald trump wrote a book and he said social security is a ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us"
"159","KAINE","and when congressman pence was in congress he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of social security even after president bush stopped pushing for it congressman pence kept pushing for it were going to stand up against efforts to privatize social security and well look for ways to keep it solvent going forward focusing primarily on the payroll tax cap"
"160","QUIJANO","governor pence ill give you an opportunity to respond"
"161","PENCE","well thanks elaine there they go again ok"
"162","KAINE","go read go read the book"
"163","PENCE","all donald trump all donald trump and i have said about social security is were going to meet our obligations to our seniors thats it"
"164","KAINE","go read the book"
"165","PENCE","weve said were going to meet the obligations of medicare thats what this campaign is really about senator and i get this is this is the old scare tactic that they roll out"
"166","KAINE","but but you have a voting record governor"
"167","PENCE","and i get all of that i just look"
"168","KAINE","i"
"169","PENCE","theres a question that you asked a little bit earlier that i want to go back to"
"170","KAINE","i cant believe that you wont defend your own voting record"
"171","PENCE","i have to go back to"
"172","QUIJANO","we"
"173","PENCE","well look i youre running with hillary clinton who wants to raise taxes by trillion increase spending by trillion and you say youre going to keep the promises of social security donald trump and i are going to cut taxes were going to were going to were going to"
"174","KAINE","youre not going to cut taxes youre going to raise taxes on the middle class"
"175","PENCE","reform government programs so we can meet the obligations of social security and medicare"
"176","QUIJANO","all right stay on the path that your party has us on were going to be in a in a mountain range of debt and were going to face hard choices and"
"177","QUIJANO","gentleman i want to move on now"
"178","KAINE","you did ask this question about debt and the debt explosion on the trump plan is much much bigger than anything on the clinton side"
"179","QUIJANO","all right let me move on now"
"180","PENCE","three hundred and five economists said your plan is bad for the economy"
"181","QUIJANO","to the issue of law enforcement and race relations law enforcement and race relations after the dallas police shooting police chief david brown said quote were asking cops to do too much in this country every societal failure we put it off on the cops to solve not enough mental health funding not enough drug addiction funding schools fail lets give it to the cops"
"182","QUIJANO","do we ask too much of police officers in this country and how would you specifically address the chiefs concerns senator kaine"
"183","KAINE","elaine i think thats a very fair comment i think we put a lot on police shoulders and this is something i got a lot of scar tissue and experience on"
"184","KAINE","i was a city councilman and mayor in richmond and when i came in we had one of the highest homicide rates in the united states we fought very very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half"
"185","KAINE","and then when i was governor of virginia we worked hard too and we did something we had really wanted to do for the first time ever we cracked the top safest states because we worked together"
"186","KAINE","heres what i learned as a mayor and a governor the way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing you build the bonds between the community and the police force build bonds of understanding and then when people feel comfortable in their communities that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows and when that gap narrows its safer for the communities and its safer for the police"
"187","KAINE","that model still works across our country but there are some other models that dont work an overly aggressive more militarized model donald trump recently said we need to do more stopandfrisk around the country that would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community"
"188","KAINE","so heres what well do well focus on community policing we will focus on and hillary clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the united states"
"189","KAINE","im a gunowner im a strong second amendment supporter but ive got a lot of scar tissue because when i was governor of virginia there was a horrible shooting at virginia tech and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime and so were going to work to do things like close background record checks and if we do we wont have the tragedies that we did"
"190","KAINE","one of those killed at virginia tech was a guy named liviu librescu he was a plusyearold romanian holocaust survivor he had survived the holocaust then he survived the soviet union takeover of his country but then he was a visiting professor at virginia tech and he couldnt survive the scourge of gun violence"
"191","KAINE","we can support the second amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer and that will make police safer too"
"192","QUIJANO","governor pence"
"193","PENCE","you know my uncle was a cop a career cop on the beat in downtown chicago he was my hero when i was growing up and wed go up to visit my dads family in chicago my three brothers and i would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform sidearm at his side"
"194","PENCE","police officers are the best of us and the men and women white africanamerican asian latino hispanic they put their lives on the line every single day and let my say at the risk of agreeing with you community policing is a great idea its worked in the hoosier state and we fully support that"
"195","PENCE","donald trump and i are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation its probably probably why the members of the fraternal order of police endorsed donald trump as the next president of the united states of america because they see his commitment to them they see his commitment to law and order"
"196","PENCE","but they also they also hear the bad mouthing the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as as a reason to to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of of implicit bias or institutional racism and that really has got to stop"
"197","PENCE","i mean when an africanamerican police officer in charlotte named brentley vinson an allstar football player who went to liberty university here in the state came home followed his dad into law enforcement joined the force in charlotte joined the force in charlotte in was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of keith keith lamont scott it was a tragedy i mean i we we mourn with those who mourn we we grieve with those who grieve and were saddened at the loss of life"
"198","PENCE","but hillary clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force where where she used when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement her only answer was that theres implicit bias in everyone in the united states i just think"
"199","KAINE","can i can i explain"
"200","PENCE","i just think what we ought to do is we ought to stop seizing on these moments of tragedy we ought to assure the public that well have a full and complete and transparent investigation whenever theres a loss of life because of police action but senator please you know enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs"
"201","KAINE","elaine elaine people shouldnt be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement and if youre afraid to have"
"202","PENCE","im not afraid to bring that up"
"203","KAINE","and if if youre afraid to have the discussion youll never solve it and so heres heres an example heartbreaking we would agree this was a heartbreaking example"
"204","KAINE","the guy philando castile who was killed in st paul he was a worker a valued worker in a local school and he was killed for no apparent reason in an incident that will be discussed and will be investigated"
"205","KAINE","but when folks went and explored this situation what they found is that philando castile who was a they called him mr rogers with dreadlocks in the school that he worked the kids loved him but he had been stopped by police or times before that fatal incident and if you look at sentencing in this country africanamericans and latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates"
"206","PENCE","we need criminal justice reform"
"207","KAINE","well we do"
"208","PENCE","indiana has passed criminal justice reform"
"209","KAINE","but i just want to say those who say that we should not"
"210","PENCE","but thats not what youre talking about"
"211","KAINE","we should not be able to bring up and talk about bias in the system well never solve the problem"
"212","QUIJANO","governor pencegovernor pence"
"213","PENCE","senator when africanamerican police officers involved in a police action shooting involving an africanamerican why would hillary clinton accuse that africanamerican police officer of implicit bias"
"214","KAINE","well i guess i cant believe you are defending the position that there is no bias and its a topic we dont even"
"215","QUIJANO","governor pence i have a question on that point"
"216","PENCE","i did not make that statement i"
"217","QUIJANO","your fellow republican governor pence senator tim scott who is africanamerican recently spoke on the senate floor he said he was stopped seven times by law enforcement in one year"
"218","KAINE","a senator"
"219","QUIJANO","he said i have felt the anger the frustration the sadness and the humiliation that comes with feeling like youre being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself what would you say to senator scott about his experiences"
"220","PENCE","well i have the deepest respect for senator scott and hes a close friend and what i would say is that we we need to adopt criminal justice reform nationally i i signed criminal justice reform in the state of indiana senator and were very proud of it"
"221","PENCE","i worked when i was congress on a second chance act we have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect on institutional bias in criminal justice but what what what donald trump and i are saying is lets not have the reflex of assuming the worst of men and women in law enforcement we truly do believe that law enforcement is not a force for racism or division in our country"
"222","KAINE","elaine can i"
"223","QUIJANO","so what would you say to senator scott governor"
"224","PENCE","law enforcement in this country is a force for good they are the they truly are people that put their lives on the line every single day but i would i would suggest to you what we need to do is assert a stronger leadership at the national level to support law enforcement you just heard senator kaine reject stopandfrisk well i would suggest to you that the families that live in our inner cities that are besieged by crime"
"225","KAINE","elaine let me let me"
"226","QUIJANO","governor the question is about senator scott what would what would you tell senator scott"
"227","KAINE","elaine if i could if i could jump in ive heard senator scott make that eloquent plea and look criminal justice is about respecting the law and being respected by the law so there is a fundamental respect issue here"
"228","KAINE","and i just want to talk about the tone thats set from the top donald trump during his campaign has called mexicans rapists and criminals hes called women slobs pigs dogs disgusting i dont like saying that in front of my wife and my mother he attacked an indianaborn federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were mexican he went after john mccain a and said he wasnt hero because hed been captured he said africanamericans are living in hell and he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that president obama is not a citizen"
"229","KAINE","if you want to have a society where people are respected and respect laws you cant have somebody at the top who demeans every group that he talks about and i just again i cannot believe that governor pence will defend the insultdriven campaign that donald trump has run"
"230","QUIJANO","all right i want to turn to our next segment now immigration your running mates have both said that undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes should be deported what would you tell the millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed violent crimes governor pence"
"231","PENCE","donald trumps laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country weve been talking it to death for years hillary clinton and tim kaine want to continue the policies of open borders amnesty catch and release sanctuary cities all the things that are driving that are driving wages down in this country senator and also too often with criminal aliens in the country its bringing heartbreak"
"232","PENCE","but i donald trump has a plan that he laid out in arizona that will deal systemically with illegal immigration beginning with border security internal enforcement its probably why for the first time in the history of immigration and customs enforcement their union actually endorsed donald trump as the next president of the united states because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country"
"233","PENCE","and donald trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens remove people that have overstayed their visas and and once we have accomplished all of that which will which will strengthen our economy strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out then well deal with those that remain"
"234","PENCE","but i have to tell you i just i was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of senator kaine a minute ago these were donalds hold on a second governor"
"235","PENCE","its my time senator"
"236","QUIJANO","it is in fact the governors time"
"237","KAINE","i apologize its your two minutes i apologize"
"238","PENCE","thanks i forgive you he says ours is an insultdriven campaign did you all just hear that ours is an insultdriven campaign"
"239","PENCE","i mean to be honest with you if donald trump had said all of the things that youve said he said in the way you said he said them he still wouldnt have a fraction of the insults that hillary clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables its she said they were irredeemable they were not american"
"240","PENCE","i mean its extraordinary and then she labeled one after another ism on millions of americans who believe that we can have a stronger america at home and abroad who believe we can get this economy moving again who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all so senator this this insultdriven campaign i mean"
"241","QUIJANO","governor"
"242","PENCE","thats small potatoes compared to hillary clinton"
"243","QUIJANO","senator kaine"
"244","PENCE","calling half of donald trumps supporters a basket of deplorables"
"245","KAINE","hillary clinton said something on the campaign trail and the very next day she said you know what i shouldnt have said that"
"246","PENCE","she said she shouldnt have said half"
"247","QUIJANO","governor this is senator kaines two minutes please"
"248","KAINE","yeah thats right so now were even"
"249","PENCE","yeah laughther"
"250","KAINE","look for donald trump apologizing to john mccain for saying he wasnt a hero"
"251","PENCE","oh"
"252","KAINE","to donald trump apologizing for calling women slobs pigs dogs disgusting"
"253","PENCE","she apologized for saying half"
"254","QUIJANO","governor it is his two minutes please"
"255","KAINE","did donald trump apologize for taking after somebody in a twitter war and making fun of her weight did he apologize for saying africanamericans are living in hell did he apologize for saying president obama was not even a citizen of the united states you will look in vain to see donald trump ever taking responsibility for anybody and apologizing"
"256","KAINE","immigration theres two plans on the table hillary and i believe in comprehensive immigration reform donald trump believes in deportation nation youve got to pick your choice hillary and i want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal second that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent third that will do more border control and fourth that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard pay taxes play by the rules and take criminal background record checks"
"257","KAINE","thats our proposal donald trump proposes to deport million people million who are here without documents and both donald trump and mike pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship so if youre born here but your parents dont have documents they want to eliminate that thats another million people"
"258","KAINE","these guys and donald trump have said it deportation force they want to go house to house school to school business to business and kick out million people and i cannot believe"
"259","PENCE","thats nonsense thats nonsense"
"260","KAINE","i cannot believe that governor pence would sit here and defend his running mates claim that we should create a deportation force to so that theyll all be gone"
"261","PENCE","senator we have a deportation force its called immigrations and customs enforcement and the union for immigrations and customs enforcement for the first time in their history endorsed donald trump to be the next president of the united states of america"
"262","KAINE","so you like the million deportations"
"263","PENCE","senator thats thats nonsense look what you just heard is they have a plan for open borders amnesty thats"
"264","KAINE","our plan is like ronald reagans plan from "
"265","PENCE","they call it comprehensive immigration reform they call it comprehensive immigration reform on capitol hill we all know the routine its amnesty and you heard one of the last things he mentioned was border security"
"266","PENCE","thats how washington always plays it"
"267","KAINE","no i"
"268","PENCE","they always say were going to do this were going to do that well eventually get the border"
"269","KAINE","border security three years ago and governor pence was against it"
"270","QUIJANO","governor mr trump has said"
"271","PENCE","ronald reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation donald trump is committed to restoring the borders of this nation and securing our nation enforcing our laws"
"272","QUIJANO","so governor how would these millions of undocumented immigrants leave would they be forcibly removed"
"273","PENCE","well i think donald trump laid out a series of priorities that doesnt ends with border security it begins with border security and after we secure the border not only build a wall but beneath the ground and in the air we do internal enforcement"
"274","PENCE","but he said the focus has to be on criminal aliens we just we just had a conversation about law enforcement we just had a conversation about the the violence thats besetting our cities the reality is that theres heartbreak and tragedy that has struck american families because people that came into this country illegally are now involved in criminal enterprise and activity and we dont have the resources or the will to deport them systemically"
"275","PENCE","donald trump has said were going to move those people out people whove overstayed their visas were going to enforce the law of this country were going to strengthen immigrations and customs enforcements with more resources and more personnel to be able to do that and then donald trump has made it clear once weve done all of those things that were going to reform the immigration system that we have"
"276","KAINE","i just have to correct governor pence"
"277","PENCE","where people can come into this country"
"278","KAINE","i have to"
"279","PENCE","thats the order that you should do it border security removing criminal aliens upholding with law and then but then senator ill work you when you go back to the senate i promise you well work you to reform the immigration system"
"280","KAINE","i look forward to working together in whatever capacities we serve in but i just want to make it very very clear that hes trying to fuzz up what donald trump has said when donald trump spoke in phoenix he looked the audience in the eye and he said no were building a wall and were deporting everybody he said quote they will all be gone they will all be gone and this is one of these ones where you can just go to the tape on it and see what donald trump has said and to add"
"281","PENCE","hes talking about criminal aliens"
"282","KAINE","and to add to it and to add to it and to add to it we are a nation of immigrants mike pence and i both are descended from immigrant families some things you know maybe werent said so great about the irish when they came but weve done well by absorbing immigrants and its made our nation stronger"
"283","KAINE","when donald trump says mexicans are rapists and criminals mexican immigrants when donald trump says about your judge a hoosier judge he said that judge curiel was unqualified to hear a case because his parents were mexican i cant imagine how you could defend that"
"284","QUIJANO","gentleman id like to shift now to the threat of terrorism do you think the world today is a safer or more dangerous place than it was eight years ago has the terrorist threat increased or decreased senator kaine"
"285","KAINE","the terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because bin laden is dead the terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped the terrorist threat to united states troops has been decreased in some ways because theres not in a dangerous part of the world theres only "
"286","KAINE","but there are other parts of the world that are challenging let me tell you this to beat terrorism theres only one candidate who can do it and its hillary clinton remember hillary clinton was the senator from new york on she was there at the world trade center when they were still searching for victims and survivors thats seared onto her the need to beat terrorism"
"287","KAINE","and shes got a plan to do it she was part of the national security team that wiped out bin laden heres her plan to defeat first weve got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield she was part of the team that got bin laden and shell lead the team that will get abu bakr albaghdadi the head of isis"
"288","KAINE","second weve got to disrupt financing networks third disrupt their ability to recruit on the internet in their safe havens but fourth we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence thats the hillary clinton plan shes got the experience to do it"
"289","KAINE","donald trump donald trump cant start a twitter war with miss universe without shooting himself in the foot donald trump doesnt have a plan he said i have a secret plan and then he said um i know more than all the generals about and then he said im going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan and finally he said im going to fire all the generals he doesnt have a plan"
"290","KAINE","but he does have dangerous ideas heres four he trash talks the military the military is a disaster john mccains no hero the generals need all to be fired and i know more than them he wants to tear up alliances is obsolete and well only work together with israel if they pay big league"
"291","KAINE","third he loves dictators hes got kind of a personal mount rushmore vladimir putin kim jongun moammar gadhafi"
"292","PENCE","oh please come on"
"293","KAINE","and saddam hussein and last and most dangerously donald trump believes donald trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons hes said saudi arabia should get them japan should get them korea should get them and when he was confronted with this and told wait a minute terrorists could get those proliferation could lead to nuclear war heres what donald trump said and i quote go ahead folks enjoy yourselves"
"294","KAINE","id love to hear governor pence tell me whats so enjoyable or comical about nuclear war"
"295","QUIJANO","governor pence"
"296","PENCE","did you work on that one a long time because that had a lot of really creative lines in it"
"297","KAINE","well im going to see if you can defend any of it"
"298","PENCE","well look i can defend i i i can i can make very clear to the american people after traveling millions of miles as our secretary of state after being the architect of the foreign policy of this administration america is less safe today than it was the day that barack obama became president of the united states its absolutely inarguable"
"299","PENCE","weve weakened americas place in the world its been a combination of factors but mostly its been a lack of leadership i mean i will give you and i was in washington on i saw the clouds of smoke rise from the pentagon"
"300","KAINE","i was in virginia where the pentagons"
"301","PENCE","i know you were we all lived through that day as a nation it was heartbreaking and i want to give this president credit for bringing osama bin laden to justice"
"302","PENCE","but the truth is osama bin laden led al qaida our primary threat today is isis and because hillary clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some american combat troops to remain in iraq and secure the hard fought gains the american soldier had won by isis was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert and its overrun vast areas that the american soldier had won in operation iraqi freedom"
"303","PENCE","my heart breaks for the likes of lance cpl scott zubowski he fell in fallujah in he fought hard through some of the most difficult days in operation iraqi freedom and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation and that nation was secured in "
"304","PENCE","but because hillary clinton and barack obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there we are back at war the president just ordered more troops on the ground we are back at war in iraq and scott zubowski whose mom would always come to memorial day events in newcastle indiana to see me and id give her a hug and tell her were never going to forget her son and we never will scott zubowski and the sacrifices the american soldier made were squandered in iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which isis was able to grow"
"305","PENCE","and a reference to the iranian deal the iranian deal that hillary clinton initiated billion to the radical mullahs in iran"
"306","KAINE","stopping a nuclear weapons program without firing a shot"
"307","PENCE","you didnt stop the nuclear weapons program"
"308","KAINE","yes we did"
"309","PENCE","you essentially"
"310","KAINE","even the israeli military says it stopped"
"311","PENCE","guaranteed that iran will someday become a nuclear power because theres no limitations once the period of time of the treaty comes off"
"312","QUIJANO","governor pence mr trump has proposed extreme vetting of immigrants from parts of the world that export terrorism but that does not address many of the recent terrorist attacks in the united states such as the orlando nightclub massacre and the recent bombings in new york and new jersey those were homegrown committed by citizens and legal residents what specific tools would you use to prevent those kinds of attacks"
"313","PENCE","well i think its i think its a great question elaine but it really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests particularly the safety and security of the american people first"
"314","PENCE","i mean donald trump has called for extreme vetting for people coming into this country so that we dont bring people into the united states who are hostile to our bill of rights freedoms who are hostile to the american way life"
"315","PENCE","but also donald trump and i are committed to suspending the syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism hillary clinton and tim kaine want to increase the syrian refugee program by "
"316","KAINE","elaine i want to"
"317","QUIJANO","governor the question was about homegrown"
"318","PENCE","yeah and so but first you know lets make sure were putting the safety and security of the american people first instead of hillary clinton expanding the syrian refugee program"
"319","KAINE","or instead of you violating the constitution by blocking people based on their national origin rather than whether theyre dangerous"
"320","PENCE","thats not thats absolutely false"
"321","KAINE","thats what the seventh circuit decided just heres the difference elaine"
"322","PENCE","the seventh circuit"
"323","KAINE","we have different views on on refugee issues and on immigration hillary and i want to do enforcement based on are people dangerous these guys say all mexicans are bad"
"324","PENCE","thats absolutely false"
"325","KAINE","and with respect to refugees we want to keep people out if theyre dangerous donald trump said keep them out if theyre muslim mike pence"
"326","PENCE","absolutely"
"327","KAINE","put a program in place to keep them out if theyre from syria and yesterday an appellate court with three republican judges struck down the pence plan"
"328","PENCE","right right"
"329","KAINE","and said it was discriminatory"
"330","PENCE","and those judges those judges said"
"331","KAINE","we should focus upon danger not upon discrimination"
"332","QUIJANO","governor"
"333","PENCE","elaine to your point those judges said it was because there wasnt any evidence yet that that isis had infiltrated the united states well germany just arrested three syrian refugees that were connected to isis"
"334","KAINE","but they told you theres a right way and a wrong way to do it"
"335","PENCE","but look if youre going to be critical of me on that thats fair game i will tell you after two syrian refugees were involved in the attack in paris that is called paris as governor of the state of indiana i have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of my state"
"336","KAINE","but governor pence"
"337","PENCE","so you bet i suspended that program"
"338","KAINE","but governor pence i just"
"339","PENCE","and i stand by that decision and if im vice president of the united states or donald trump is president were going to put the safety and security of the american people first"
"340","KAINE","sure can we just be clear hillary and i will do immigration enforcement and well vet refugees based on whether theyre dangerous or not we wont do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice"
"341","PENCE","but the problem with that"
"342","KAINE","that is completely antithetical to the jeffersonian values of"
"343","PENCE","elaine the director of the our homeland security said we cant know for certain who these people are coming from syria"
"344","KAINE","yes we can and when we dont let them know we dont let them in"
"345","PENCE","so the fbi"
"346","KAINE","when we dont know who they are we dont let them in"
"347","PENCE","the and homeland security said we cant know for certain youve got to err on the side of the safety and security of the american people senator i understand the"
"348","KAINE","by trashing all syrians or trashing all muslims"
"349","PENCE","the wants us to expand the syrian refugee program"
"350","QUIJANO","senator kaine let me ask you this secretary clinton"
"351","PENCE","were going to put the safety and security of the american people first"
"352","QUIJANO","has talked about an intelligence surge"
"353","KAINE","yes"
"354","QUIJANO","what exactly would an intelligence surge look like and how would that help identify terrorists with no operational connection to a foreign terrorist organization"
"355","KAINE","intelligence surge is twothirds elaine its two things its first dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals but also weve got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the united states working for many of our private sector companies"
"356","KAINE","so it involves increasing our own workforce but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can consistent with constitutional principles gather more intelligence"
"357","KAINE","but the second piece of this is really really important it also means creating stronger alliances because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies and thats how you find out who may be trying to recruit who may be trying to come to one country or the next alliances are critical"
"358","KAINE","thats why donald trumps claim that he wants to that is obsolete and that we need to get rid of is so dangerous"
"359","PENCE","thats not his plan well he said is obsolete and look if you put aside push aside your alliances who youre going to share intelligence with hillary clinton is the secretary of state who knows how to build alliances she built the sanctions regime around the word that stopped the iranian nuclear weapons program and thats what an intelligence surge means better skill and capacity but also better alliances"
"360","QUIJANO","all right id like to turn now to the tragedy in syria two hundred fifty thousand"
"361","PENCE","can i speak about the cybersecurity surge at all"
"362","QUIJANO","you can you can have seconds governor quickly please"
"363","PENCE","first donald trump just spoke about this issue this week we have got to bring together the best resources of this country to understand that cyber warfare is the new warfare of the asymmetrical enemies that we face in this country and i look forward if im privileged to be in this role of working with you in the senate to make sure that we resource that effort"
"364","KAINE","we will work together in whatever roles we inhabit"
"365","PENCE","we have an intelligence sir but i will also tell you that its important in this moment to remember that hillary clinton had a private server in her home that had classified information on it"
"366","QUIJANO","and i dont seconds is on up"
"367","PENCE","about drone strikes emails from the president of the united states of america were on there"
"368","QUIJANO","right"
"369","PENCE","her private server was subject to being hacked by foreign"
"370","QUIJANO","id like to ask you about syria governor"
"371","PENCE","we could put cybersecurity first if we just make sure the next secretary of state doesnt have a private server"
"372","KAINE","and all investigation concluded that not one reasonable prosecutor would take any additional step you dont get to decide the rights and wrongs of this we have a justice system that does that and a republican director did an investigation and concluded that"
"373","QUIJANO","all right we are moving on now two hundred fifty thousand people"
"374","PENCE","if your son or my son handled classified information the way hillary clinton did"
"375","QUIJANO","one hundred thousand of them children governor"
"376","PENCE","theyd be court martialed"
"377","KAINE","that is absolutely false and you know that"
"378","PENCE","absolutely true"
"379","KAINE","and you know that governor"
"380","QUIJANO","governor"
"381","PENCE","its absolutely true"
"382","QUIJANO","gentlemen please"
"383","KAINE","because the did an investigation"
"384","QUIJANO","gentlemen"
"385","KAINE","and they concluded that there was no reasonable prosecutor who would take it further sorry"
"386","QUIJANO","senator kaine governor pence please"
"387","KAINE","syria"
"388","QUIJANO","i want to turn now to syria two hundred fifty thousand people of them children are under siege in aleppo syria bunker buster bombs cluster munitions and incendiary weapons are being dropped on them by russian and syrian militaries does the have a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties on this scale governor pence"
"389","PENCE","the united states of america needs to begin to exercise strong leadership to protect the vulnerable citizens and over children in aleppo hillary clintons top priority when she became secretary of state was the russian reset the russians reset after the russian reset the russians invaded ukraine and took over crimea"
"390","PENCE","and the small and bullying leader of russia is now dictating terms to the united states to the point where all the united states of america the greatest nation on earth just withdraws from talks about a ceasefire while vladimir putin puts a missile defense system in syria while he marshals the forces and begins look we have got to begin to lean into this with strong broadshouldered american leadership"
"391","PENCE","it begins by rebuilding our military and the russians and the chinese have been making enormous investments in the military we have the smallest navy since we have the lowest number of troops since the end of the second world war weve got to work with congress and donald trump will to rebuild our military and project american strength in the world"
"392","PENCE","but about aleppo and about syria i truly do believe that what america ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas work with our arab partners real time right now to make that happen"
"393","PENCE","and secondly i just have to tell you that the provocations by russia need to be met with american strength and if russia chooses to be involved and continue i should say to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in aleppo the united states of america should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in aleppo"
"394","PENCE","theres a broad range of other things that we ought to do as well we ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the czech republic and poland which hillary clinton and barack obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the russians back in "
"395","QUIJANO","governor your two minutes are up"
"396","PENCE","weve just got to have american strength on the world stage when donald trump becomes president of the united states the russians and other countries in the world will know theyre dealing with a strong american president"
"397","QUIJANO","senator kaine"
"398","KAINE","hillary and i also agree that the establishment of humanitarian zones in northern syria with the provision of international human aid consistent with the security council resolution that was passed in february would be a very very good idea"
"399","KAINE","and hillary also has the ability to stand up to russia in a way that this ticket does not donald trump again and again has praised vladimir putin and its clear that he has business dealings with russian oligarchs who are very connected to putin"
"400","KAINE","the trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of those shadowy connections with proputin forces governor pence made the odd claim he said inarguably vladimir putin is a better leader than president obama vladimir putin has run his economy into the ground he persecutes folks and journalists if you dont know the difference between dictatorship and leadership then you got to go back to a fifthgrade civics class"
"401","KAINE","ill tell you what offends me"
"402","PENCE","well that offended me"
"403","KAINE","governor pence just said governor pence just said that donald trump will rebuild the military no he wont donald trump is avoiding paying taxes the new york times story and we need to get this but the new york times suggested that he probably didnt pay taxes for about years starting in those years included the years of "
"404","KAINE","so get this on hillary clinton and donald trumps hometown was attacked by the worst terrorist attack in the history of the united states young men and women young men and women signed up to serve in the military to fight terrorism hillary clinton went to washington to get funds to rebuild her city and protect first responders but donald trump was fighting a very different fight it was a fight to avoid paying taxes so that he wouldnt support the fight against terror"
"405","QUIJANO","the question was about aleppo senator"
"406","KAINE","he wouldnt support troops he wouldnt he wouldnt support this is important elaine when a guy running for president will not support the troops not support veterans not support teachers thats really important"
"407","QUIJANO","right"
"408","KAINE","and i said about aleppo we do agree the notion is we have to create a humanitarian zone in northern syria its very important"
"409","QUIJANO","governor pence you had mentioned nofly zone where would you propose setting up a safe zone specifically how would you keep it safe"
"410","PENCE","well first and foremost donald trump supports our troops donald trump supports our veterans"
"411","KAINE","he wont pay taxes"
"412","PENCE","donald trump has paid all the taxes that hes do you not take deductions how does that work"
"413","QUIJANO","gentlemen this is about syria id like to"
"414","PENCE","honestly senator honestly senator"
"415","KAINE","it is about our troops it is about our troops"
"416","PENCE","i understand why you want to change i understand why you want to change the subject"
"417","KAINE","how can you support the troops if you wont pay taxes"
"418","PENCE","i understand why you want to change the subject and let me be very clear on this russian thing the larger question here"
"419","KAINE","do you think donald trump is smart to not pay taxes"
"420","QUIJANO","gentlemen were going to have time to get to russia here"
"421","PENCE","what were dealing with is the you know theres an old proverb that says the russian bear never dies it just hibernates and the truth of the matter is the weak and feckless foreign policy of hillary clinton and barack obama has awakened an aggression in russia that first appeared a few years ago with their move in georgia now their move into crimea now their move into the wider middle east"
"422","PENCE","and all the while all we do is fold our arms and say were not having talks anymore to answer your question we just need american strength we need to we need to marshal the resources of our allies in the region and in the immediate we need to act and act now to get people out of harms way"
"423","QUIJANO","and exactly how would those safe zones work how would they remain safe"
"424","PENCE","the the safe zones would have to be as the senator said theres already a framework for this thats been recognized by the international community the united states of america needs to be prepared to work with our allies in the region to create a route for safe passage and then to protect people in those areas including with a nofly zone"
"425","PENCE","but look this is very tough stuff i served on the foreign affairs committee for a decade i traveled in and out of that region for years i saw what the american soldier won in operation iraqi freedom and to see the weak and feckless leadership that hillary clinton was the architect of and the foreign policy of the obama administration"
"426","KAINE","well let me let me come back"
"427","PENCE","is deeply troubling to me that will all change the day donald trump becomes president of the united states"
"428","KAINE","and talk about let me talk about the things that governor pence doesnt want to acknowledge elaine he doesnt want to acknowledge that we stopped the iranian nuclear weapons program he doesnt want to acknowledge"
"429","PENCE","we didnt"
"430","KAINE","that hillary was part of a team that got bin laden he doesnt want to acknowledge"
"431","PENCE","i just did"
"432","KAINE","that its a good thing not a bad thing that its a good thing not a bad thing that were down from troops deployed overseas to "
"433","KAINE","but let me tell you what will really make the middle east dangerous donald trumps idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons saudi arabia japan south korea ronald reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the s he said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event and i think thats who governor pences running mate is exactly who governor reagan warned us about"
"434","PENCE","and come on senator senator that was even beneath you and hillary clinton and that thats pretty low"
"435","KAINE","but do you do you think do you think we should have more nuclear weapons in the world will make us safer"
"436","PENCE","senator the"
"437","KAINE","thats what donald trump thinks"
"438","PENCE","ronald reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought because it can never be won and the united states of america needs to make investments in modernizing our nuclear force for both deterrence"
"439","KAINE","but can you defend donald trumps claim that more nations should get nuclear weapons"
"440","PENCE","and assurance to our allies but let me go back to this iran thing i mean he keeps saying that they prevented that hillary clinton started the deal with the iranians prevented iran from getting a nuclear weapon"
"441","KAINE","thats what the israeli joint chiefs of staff is saying right now"
"442","PENCE","well thats not what thats not what israel thinks"
"443","KAINE","gadi eizenkot you can go check it"
"444","PENCE","you wouldnt necessarily know that"
"445","KAINE","go to the tape"
"446","PENCE","i know you boycotted prime minister netanyahus speech when he came before the congress"
"447","KAINE","no i visited him in his office i visited him in his office"
"448","PENCE","you boycotted the speech the point is what this iran socalled iran deal did was essentially guarantee i mean when i was in congress i fought hard on a bipartisan basis with republican and democrat members to move forward the toughest sanctions it literally in the history of the united states against iran"
"449","KAINE","and then hillary used them to get a deal"
"450","PENCE","we were bringing them to heel but the goal was always that we would only lift the sanctions if iran permanently renounced their nuclear ambitions"
"451","KAINE","elaine let me just mention one thing"
"452","PENCE","they have not elaine let me finish a sentence they have not renounced their nuclear ambitions and when the deals period runs out theres no limitation on them obtaining weapons that"
"453","QUIJANO","and very quickly senator"
"454","KAINE","elaine"
"455","PENCE","and the fact that they got billion in a ransom payment"
"456","QUIJANO","we need to talk about russia very quickly though senator please"
"457","PENCE","is astonishing to the american people"
"458","KAINE","six times tonight i have said to governor pence i cant imagine how you can defend your running mates position on one issue after the next and in all six cases hes refused to defend his running mate"
"459","PENCE","well lets no no dont put words in my mouth"
"460","QUIJANO","all right"
"461","PENCE","hes going"
"462","KAINE","and yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend and i just think that should be underlined"
"463","PENCE","no im look"
"464","QUIJANO","all right gentlemen lets talk about russia this is a topic that has come up"
"465","PENCE","im very very happy to defend donald trump if he wants to take these one at a time ill take them one at a time"
"466","QUIJANO","i will give you an opportunity to do that"
"467","KAINE","more nations should get nuclear weapons try to defend that"
"468","PENCE","dont put words in my mouth well he never said that senator"
"469","KAINE","he absolutely said it saudi arabia south korea japan"
"470","PENCE","most of the stuffy youve said hes never said"
"471","QUIJANO","gentlemen russia russian president vladimir putin invaded ukraine annexed crimea and has provided crucial military support to the assad regime what steps if any would your administration take to counter these actions senator kaine"
"472","KAINE","youve got to be tough on russia so lets start with not praising vladimir putin as a great leader donald trump and mike pence have said hes a great leader and donald trump has business"
"473","PENCE","no we havent"
"474","KAINE","has business dealings has business dealings with russia that he refuses to disclose hillary clinton has gone toeto toe with russia she went toetotoe with russia as secretary of state to do the new agreement to reduce russias nuclear stockpile shes had the experience doing it"
"475","KAINE","she went toetotoe with russia and lodged protests when they went into georgia and weve done the same thing about ukraine but more than launching protests weve put punishing economic sanctions on russia that we need to continue"
"476","KAINE","donald trump on the other hand didnt know that russia had invaded the crimea"
"477","PENCE","oh thats nonsense"
"478","KAINE","he was on a show a couple months back and he said ill guarantee you this russias not going into the ukraine and he had to be reminded that they had gone into the crimea two years before"
"479","PENCE","he knew that"
"480","KAINE","hillary clinton has gone toetotoe with russia to work out a deal on new she got them engaged on a meaningful way to cap irans nuclear weapons program and yet she stood up to them on issues such as syria and their invasion of georgia youve got to have the ability to do that and hillary does"
"481","KAINE","on the other hand in donald trump you have somebody who praises vladimir putin all the time america should really wonder about a president trump who had a campaign manager with ties to putin pro putin elements in the ukraine who had to be fired for that reason they should wonder when donald trump is sitting down with vladimir putin is it going to be americas bottom line or is it going to be donald trumps bottom line that hes going to be worried about with all of his business dealings"
"482","KAINE","now this could be solved if donald trump would be willing to release his tax returns as he told the american public that he would do and i know hes laughing at this but every president"
"483","PENCE","but whats it got to do with russia"
"484","KAINE","every president since richard nixon has done it and donald trump has said im doing business with russia the only way the american public will see whether he has a conflict of interest"
"485","PENCE","no he hasnt said that"
"486","KAINE","he has actually"
"487","QUIJANO","senator your time is up governor"
"488","PENCE","well thanks im just trying to keep up with the insultdriven campaign on the other side of the table"
"489","KAINE","you know im just saying facts about your running mate"
"490","PENCE","yeah"
"491","KAINE","and i know you cant defend"
"492","QUIJANO","senator please this is the governors two minutes"
"493","PENCE","im happy to defend him senator dont put words in my mouth that im not defending him"
"494","KAINE","youre not"
"495","PENCE","im happy to defend him most of what you said is completely false and the american people know that"
"496","KAINE","ill run through the list of things where you wont defend"
"497","PENCE","this isnt the old days where you can just say stuff and people believe it"
"498","QUIJANO","senator please this is governor pences two minutes"
"499","PENCE","look this is the alternative universe of washington versus reality hillary clinton said her numberone priority was a reset with russia that reset resulted in the invasion of ukraine after theyd infiltrated with what are called little green men russian soldiers that were dressing up like ukrainian dissidents and then they moved all the way into crimea took over the crimean peninsula donald trump knew that happened he basically was saying its not going to happen again the truth of the matter is that what you have in the rise of aggressive russia which has had increased its influence in iran thats now now because of this deal is on a pathway in the future to obtain a nuclear the leading state sponsor of terror in the world in iran now has a closer working relationship with russia because of hillary clinton and barack obamas foreign policy and billion and sanctions all being lifted"
"500","PENCE","and then of course syria i mean it really is extraordinary that syria is imploding you just asked a very thoughtful question about the disaster in aleppo isis is headquartered in raqqa it is isis from raqqa has overrun vast areas that at great sacrifice the american soldier won in operation iraqi freedom and yet senator kaine still sits here loyal soldier i get all that in saying that the foreign policy of hillary clinton and barack obama somehow made the world more secure i mean it really is astonishing that on the day"
"501","KAINE","we even wiped out the leader of al qaida"
"502","PENCE","on the day that iran released four american hostages"
"503","KAINE","we stopped iran from getting nuclear weapons"
"504","QUIJANO","governor"
"505","PENCE","we delivered million in cash as a ransom payment for americans held by the radical mullahs in tehran"
"506","QUIJANO","governor yesterday mr trump said"
"507","KAINE","and we stopped a nuclear weapons program without a shot"
"508","QUIJANO","quote putin has no respect for hillary clinton and no respect for obama why do you think hell respect a trump pence administration"
"509","PENCE","strength plain and simple"
"510","KAINE","business dealings"
"511","PENCE","donald trump thats nonsense donald trump is a strong leader"
"512","KAINE","donald trumps son says that the trump organization"
"513","PENCE","who is going to lead with american strength"
"514","QUIJANO","please senator ill give you a chance to respond"
"515","PENCE","were going to rebuild our military and let me let me this whole putin thing look america is stronger than russia our economy is times larger than the russian economy americas political system is superior to the crony corrupt capitalist system in russia in every way"
"516","PENCE","when donald trump and i observe that as ive said in syria in iran in ukraine that the small and bullying leader of russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration thats stating painful facts thats not an endorsement of vladimir putin thats an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership"
"517","QUIJANO","senator kaine"
"518","PENCE","of hillary clinton and barack obama"
"519","KAINE","well this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it but governor pence said inarguably vladimir putin is a better leader than president obama"
"520","PENCE","that is absolutely inaccurate"
"521","KAINE","and and and i just think a guy who praises"
"522","PENCE","he said hes stronger hes been stronger on the world stage"
"523","KAINE","no he said leader and if and ill just say this governor"
"524","PENCE","you just said better"
"525","KAINE","if you mistake leadership for dictatorship and you cant tell the difference a country thats running its economy into the ground"
"526","PENCE","yeah here we go this is the grade school thing again"
"527","KAINE","persecuting journalists"
"528","PENCE","right this is grade school"
"529","KAINE","if you cant tell the difference you shouldnt be commanderinchief"
"530","PENCE","yeah"
"531","KAINE","and with donald trump donald trumps sons say that they have all these business dealings with russia those could be disclosed with tax returns but they refuse to do them americans need to worry about whether donald trump will be watching out for americas bottom line or his own bottom line"
"532","QUIJANO","senator kaine what went wrong with the russia reset"
"533","KAINE","vladimir putin vladimir putin is a dictator"
"534","QUIJANO","and what would do you differently"
"535","KAINE","vladimir putin is a dictator hes not a leader anybody who thinks otherwise doesnt know russian history and they dont know vladimir putin hillary clinton knows exactly who this guy is john mccain said i look in his eyes and i see and hillary kind of has that same feeling"
"536","PENCE","right"
"537","KAINE","so how do deal with him youve got to we do have to deal with russia in a lot of different ways there are areas where we can cooperate so it was hillary clinton who worked with russia on the new treaty to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile it was hillary clinton that worked with russia to get them engaged in a community of nations to stop the iranian nuclear weapons without firing a shot"
"538","KAINE","shes not going around praising vladimir putin as a great guy but she knows how to sit down at a table and negotiate tough deals this is a very challenging part of the world and we ought to have a commanderinchief who is prepared and done it rather than somebody who goes around praising vladimir putin as a great leader"
"539","QUIJANO","all right id like to ask now about north korea iran and the threat of nuclear weapons north korea recently conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test"
"540","PENCE","right"
"541","QUIJANO","what specific steps would you take to prevent north korea from developing a nucleararmed missile capable of reaching the united states governor pence"
"542","PENCE","well first we need to we need to make a commitment to rebuild our military including modernizing our nuclear forces and we also need we also need an effective american diplomacy that will marshal the resources of nations in the asian pacific rim to put pressure on north korea on kim jongun to abandon his nuclear ambitions it has to remain the policy of the united states of america the denuclearization of the korean peninsula plain and simple"
"543","PENCE","and when donald trump is president of the united states were were not going to have the the kind of posture in the world that has russia invading crimea and ukraine that has the chinese building new islands in the south china sea that has literally the world including north korea flouting american power were going to were going to go back to the days of peace through strength"
"544","PENCE","but i have to tell you that that all this talk about tax returns and i get it you know you want to keep bringing that up it must have must have"
"545","KAINE","until he"
"546","PENCE","done well in some focus group but here hillary clinton and her husband set up a private foundation called the clinton foundation while she was secretary of state the clinton foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors"
"547","PENCE","now you all need to know out there this is basic stuff foreign donors and certainly foreign governments cannot participate in the american political process they cannot make financial contributions but the clintons figured out a way to create a foundation where foreign governments and foreign donors could donate millions of dollars and then we found thanks to the good work of the associated press that more than half her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the clinton foundation when you talk about all these all these baseless rumors about russia and the rest hillary clinton you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning the reason"
"548","QUIJANO","governor your two minutes are up"
"549","PENCE","the reason the american people dont trust hillary clinton is because they are looking at the pay to play politics that she operated with the clinton foundation through a private server"
"550","QUIJANO","governor please"
"551","PENCE","while shes secretary of state"
"552","QUIJANO","your two minutes are up governor"
"553","PENCE","and theyre saying enough is enough"
"554","QUIJANO","senator kaine"
"555","KAINE","im going to talk about the foundation and then ill talk about north korea so on the foundation i am glad to talk about the foundation the clinton foundation is one of the highest rated charities in the world it provides drugs to about million people it helps americans deal with opioid overdoses it gets higher rankings for its charity than the american red cross does the clinton foundation does an awful lot of good work"
"556","KAINE","hillary clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation the state department did an investigation and they concluded that everything hillary clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the united states so the foundation does good work and hillary clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the united states"
"557","KAINE","but lets compare this now with the trump organization and the trump foundation the trump organization is an octopuslike organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if donald trump would release his tax returns hes refused to do it"
"558","KAINE","his sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in russia and remember the trump organization is not a nonprofit its putting money into donald trumps pockets and into the pockets of his children whereas the clinton foundation is a non profit and no clinton family member draws any salary"
"559","PENCE","the trump foundation is nonprofit"
"560","KAINE","in addition donald trump has a foundation the foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a florida attorney general they made an illegal contribution and then they tried to hide it by disguising it to somebody else and the person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating trump university"
"561","KAINE","this is the difference between a foundation that does good work and a secretary of state who acted in accordance with american interest and somebody who is conflicted and doing work around the world and wont share with the american public what hes doing and what those conflicts are"
"562","QUIJANO","governor i will give you seconds to respond because i know you want to but again i would remind you both this was about north korea laughther"
"563","PENCE","well thank you thank you the trump foundation is a private family foundation they give virtually every cent in the trump foundation to charitable causes"
"564","KAINE","political contributions"
"565","PENCE","less than ten cents on the dollar in the clinton foundation has gone to charitable causes"
"566","KAINE","a portrait of donald trump less than cents on the dollar of the clinton foundation has gone to charitable causes"
"567","KAINE","ninety percent"
"568","PENCE","it has been a platform for the clintons to travel the world to have staff but honestly senator we would know a lot more about it if hillary clinton would just turn over the emails"
"569","QUIJANO","all right lets turn back to north korea"
"570","PENCE","that she refused to turn over in her private server"
"571","QUIJANO","senator kaine"
"572","PENCE","and wed have a much better picture of what the clinton foundation was about"
"573","QUIJANO","senator kaine if you had intelligence that north korea was about to launch a missile a nucleararmed missile capable of reaching the united states would you take preemptive action"
"574","KAINE","if we look a president should take action to defend the united states against imminent threat you have to a president has to do that now exactly what action you would have to determine what your intelligence was how certain you were of that intelligence but you would have to take action"
"575","KAINE","you asked the question about how do we deal with a north korea im on the foreign relations committee we just did an extensive sanctions package against north korea and interestingly enough elaine the followed and did this virtually the same package often china will use their veto in the security council to veto a package like that theyre starting to get worried about north korea too so they actually supported the sanctions package even though many of the sanctions are against chinese firms chinese financial institutions"
"576","KAINE","so were working together with china and we need to chinas another one of those relationships where its competitive its also challenging and in times like north korea we have to be able to cooperate hillary understands that very well she went once famously to china and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said womens rights are human rights they didnt want her to say that but she did"
"577","KAINE","but shes also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with china and thats what its going to take"
"578","KAINE","the thing i would worry a little bit about is that donald trump owes about million to banks including the bank of china im not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money"
"579","QUIJANO","all right id like to turn to our next segment now and in this id like to focus on social issues you have both been open about the role that faith has played in your lives can you discuss in detail a time when you struggled to balance your personal faith and a public policy position senator kaine"
"580","KAINE","yeah thats an easy one for me elaine its an easy one im really fortunate i grew up in a wonderful household with great irish catholic parents my mom and dad are sitting right here i was educated by jesuits at rockhurst high school in kansas city my th reunion is in days"
"581","KAINE","and i worked with jesuit missionaries in honduras now nearly years ago and they were the heroes of my life i try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life but i dont believe in this nation a first amendment nation where we dont raise any religion over the other and we allow people to worship as they please that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone"
"582","KAINE","for me the hardest struggle in my faith life was the catholic church is against the death penalty and so am i but i was governor of a state and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous and so i had to grapple with that"
"583","KAINE","when i was running for governor i was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty but i looked the voters of virginia in the eye and said look this is my religion im not going to change my religious practice to get one vote but i know how to take an oath and uphold the law and if you elect me i will uphold the law"
"584","KAINE","and i was elected and i did it was very very difficult to allow executions to go forward but in circumstances where i didnt feel like there was a case for clemency i told virginia voters i would uphold the law and i did"
"585","KAINE","that was a real struggle but i think it is really really important that those of us who have deep faith lives dont feel that we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society regardless of their views"
"586","QUIJANO","governor pence"
"587","PENCE","well its a wonderful question and my christian faith is at the very heart of who i am i was also raised in a wonderful family of faith it was a church on sunday morning and grace before dinner"
"588","PENCE","but my christian faith became real for me when i made a personal decision for christ when i was a freshman in college and ive tried to live that out however imperfectly every day of my life since and with my wife at my side weve followed a calling into public service where weve weve tried to weve tried to keep faith with the values that we cherish"
"589","PENCE","and with regard to when i struggle i appreciate and and and i have a great deal of respect for senator kaines sincere faith i truly do"
"590","KAINE","thats shared"
"591","PENCE","but for me i would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that that ancient principle that where god says before you were formed in the womb i knew you and so for my first time in public life i sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life"
"592","PENCE","the state of indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women nonabortion alternatives im also very pleased at the fact were well on our way in indiana to becoming the most proadoption state in america i think if youre going to be prolife you should you should be pro adoption"
"593","PENCE","but what i cant understand is with hillary clinton and now senator kaine at her side is to support a practice like partialbirth abortion i mean to hold to the view and i know senator kaine you hold prolife views personally but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me"
"594","PENCE","and i cannot i cant conscience about about a party that supports that or that i know youve historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion but hillary clinton wants to wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldnt use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion"
"595","PENCE","so for me my faith informs my life i try and spend a little time on my knees every day but it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity the worth the value of every human life"
"596","KAINE","elaine this is a fundamental question a fundamental question hillary and i are both people out of religious backgrounds from methodist church experience which was really formative for her as a public servant"
"597","KAINE","but we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith but it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else"
"598","KAINE","so lets talk about abortion and choice lets talk about them we support roe v wade we support the constitutional right of american women to consult their own conscience their own supportive partner their own minister but then make their own decision about pregnancy thats something we trust american women to do that"
"599","KAINE","and we dont think that women should be punished as donald trump said they should for making the decision to have an abortion"
"600","KAINE","governor pence wants to repeal roe v wade he said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history and we have some young people in the audience who werent even born when roe was decided this is pretty important before roe v wade states could pass criminal laws to do just that to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy"
"601","KAINE","i think you should live your moral values but the last thing the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices and that is the fundamental difference between a clintonkaine ticket and a trump pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice"
"602","PENCE","no its really not donald trump and i would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy"
"603","KAINE","then why did donald trump say that"
"604","PENCE","we just never would"
"605","KAINE","why did he say that"
"606","PENCE","well look its look hes not a polished politician like you and hillary clinton and so"
"607","KAINE","well i would admit thats not a polished"
"608","PENCE","you know things dont always come out exactly the way he means them"
"609","KAINE","well can i say"
"610","PENCE","but im telling you what the policy of our administration would be"
"611","KAINE","great line from the great line from the gospel of matthew from the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks"
"612","PENCE","yeah"
"613","KAINE","when donald trump says women should be punished or mexicans are rapists and criminals"
"614","PENCE","im telling you"
"615","KAINE","or john mccain is not a hero he is showing you who he is"
"616","PENCE","senator youve whipped out that mexican thing again he look"
"617","KAINE","can you defend it"
"618","PENCE","there are criminal aliens in this country tim who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking american lives"
"619","KAINE","you want to you want to use a big broad brush against mexicans on that"
"620","PENCE","he also said and many of them are good people you keep leaving that out of your quote and if you want me to go there ill go there"
"621","PENCE","but heres there is a choice and it is a choice on life i couldnt be more proud to be standing with donald trump whos standing for the right to life its a principle that senator kaine and im very gentle about this because i really do respect you its a principle that you embrace"
"622","PENCE","and i have appreciated the fact that youve supported the hyde amendment which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion in the past but thats not hillary clintons view people need to understand we can come together as a nation we can create a culture of life more and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are were better for it we can like mother teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast"
"623","KAINE","this is important "
"624","PENCE","bring the lets welcome the children into our world there are so many families around the country who cant have children we could improve adoption"
"625","KAINE","but governor"
"626","PENCE","so that families that cant have children can adopt more readily those children from crisis pregnancies"
"627","KAINE","governor why dont you trust women to make this choice for themselves we can encourage people to support life of course we can but why dont you trust women why doesnt donald trump trust women to make this choice for themselves"
"628","KAINE","thats what we ought to be doing in public life living our lives of faith or motivation with enthusiasm and excitement convincing other dialoguing with each other about important moral issues of the day"
"629","PENCE","because there are"
"630","KAINE","but on fundamental issues of morality we should let women make their own decisions"
"631","PENCE","because there is a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable the aged the infirm the disabled and the unborn i believe it with all my heart and i couldnt be more proud to be standing with a prolife candidate in donald trump"
"632","QUIJANO","i do have one final question for you both tonight it has been a divisive campaign senator kaine if your ticket wins what specifically are you going to do to unify the country and reassure the people who voted against you"
"633","KAINE","thats a really important one that may be the question because it has been a divisive campaign and again hillary is running a campaign about stronger together and donald trump and this is this is not directed at this man except to the extent that he cant defend donald trump donald trump has run a campaign thats been about one insult after the next"
"634","KAINE","but we do have to bring the country together so heres what well do hillary clinton was first lady then senator for eight years and secretary of state and i served in the senate and im really amazed elaine as i talk to republican senators how well they regard and respect hillary clinton"
"635","KAINE","she was on the armed services committee she was on other committees she worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the program passed so that million lowincome kids have health insurance in this country including in indiana"
"636","KAINE","she worked across the aisle after to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the pentagon she worked to get benefits for benefits for national guard members including hoosiers and virginians in the national guard"
"637","KAINE","she has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen and you know elaine i have the same track record i was a governor of virginia with two republican houses and in the senate i have good working relationships across the aisle"
"638","KAINE","because i think its fine to be a democrat or republican or independent but after election day the goal is work together and hillary clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new congress in january"
"639","QUIJANO","governor how will you unify the country if you win"
"640","PENCE","well thank you elaine and thanks for a great discussion"
"641","KAINE","absolutely"
"642","PENCE","tonight thank you senator"
"643","PENCE","this is a very challenging time in the life of our nation weakened americas place in the world after the leadership of hillary clinton and barack obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling stifled by an avalanche of more taxes more regulation obamacare the war on coal and the kind of trade deals that have put american workers in the back seat i think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in washington dc"
"644","PENCE","you know i served in washington for years in the congress of the united states and i served with many republicans and democrats men and women of goodwill the potential is there to really change the direction of this country but its going to take leadership to do it"
"645","PENCE","the american people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again they want to see us supporting our military rebuilding our military commanding the respect of the world and they want to see the american economy off to the races again they want to see an american comeback"
"646","PENCE","and donald trumps entire career has been about building its been about its going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and when donald trump becomes president of the united states were going to have a stronger america"
"647","PENCE","when you hear him say he wants to make america great again when we do that i truly do believe the american people are going to be standing taller theyre going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it and when that happens the american people are going to stand tall stand together and well have the kind of unity thats been missing for way too long"
"648","QUIJANO","all right gentlemen thank you so much"
